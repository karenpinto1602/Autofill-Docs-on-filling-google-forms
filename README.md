### Auto fill a Google Docs Template
(For my reference)

https://jeffreyeverhart.com/2020/09/29/auto-fill-a-google-doc-template-from-google-sheet-data/

> In the google sheet, under the extensions tab, click on AppScript <br/>
> Enter the code (given in CreateNewDocs.txt) and excecute it <br/>
> Follow the template format <br/>
> After running the code, do not mess with the columns in the google sheet <br/>
> In the sheets, a new Tab by the name "AutoFill Docs" will appear, click that and your individual docs will be ready
